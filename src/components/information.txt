What is default method type of fetch Api ->GET or POST
When I do fetch('https://swapi.dve/api/films') what is the default method type here?
What is json? Why do we do response.json() ?
What does fetch() return? Why do we need to use 'then'?
Why cant we simply write const response. = fetch(url)

If we connect databases from frontend itself we have to write code for it,
this will show our database information to users ,and service takers by inspecting it.
So this can lead to information leakage.
The solution to this is to use backend language where we keep our all logic and 
request to database and connect it with our frontend part so the problem can never be occur.

1)
The default method type for the Fetch API is GET. When we use the fetch() function
 without specifying the method type, it assumes a GET request by default.

2)
In example, the fetch('https://swapi.dev/api/films') call is using the GET method to
 retrieve data from the specified URL.

3)
JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is a lightweight data format used for
storing and exchanging data between a server and a client (such as a web browser).
It is easy for both humans and machines to read and write.
So, when we do response.json(), we are essentially converting the raw response data
into a object format that we can work with conveniently in JavaScript.

4)
When we make a request to a server using the Fetch API, the fetch() function returns
a Promise. A Promise is an object that represents a value that may be available now
or in the future. In the case of fetch(), the Promise represents the eventual completion
 or failure of the network request.
So, when we call fetch('https://example.com/api/data'), we receive a Promise as the
return value. This Promise will resolve with a Response object once the network request
is complete.
Now, why do we need to use 'then'? 'then' is a method that allows us to handle the result
of a Promise. It takes a callback function as an argument, which will be executed when the
Promise is resolved.
In the context of fetch(), we use 'then' to handle the Response object returned by the Promise.
So, by using 'then', we can handle the asynchronous nature of the fetch() function
and perform actions on the resolved Response object and the extracted data in a structured and sequential manner.

5)
When we make a request using the Fetch API, the network request is typically asynchronous.
This means that JavaScript code execution continues without waiting for the response to arrive.
If we wrote const response = fetch(url) without any additional code, the response would not be immediately
available.


What do 4XX responses mean? Explain a few of them.
What do 5XX responses mean? Explain a few of them.

4XX Responses:
400 Bad Request: The server cannot understand the client's request due to malformed syntax or invalid parameters.
401 Unauthorized: The client needs to provide valid authentication credentials to access the requested resource.
403 Forbidden: The server understands the request but refuses to fulfill it. The client does not have the necessary permissions.
404 Not Found: The requested resource could not be found on the server.

5XX Responses:
500 Internal Server Error: A generic error message indicating that an unexpected condition occurred on the server.
502 Bad Gateway: The server acting as a gateway received an invalid response from an upstream server.
503 Service Unavailable: The server is temporarily unable to handle the request, usually due to being overloaded or undergoing maintenance.
